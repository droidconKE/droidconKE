# Development Environment

The app is written  in Java and Kotlin and uses the Gradle build system.

To build the app, use the `gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in
Android Studio. A canary or stable version >= 3.2 of Android Studio is
required and may be downloaded
[here](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive).

# Architecture

The architecture is built around
[Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/).

We followed the recommendations laid out in the
[Guide to App Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide)
when deciding on the architecture for the app. We kept logic away from
Activities and Fragments and moved it to
[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)s.
We observed data using
[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)


We used a Repository layer for handling data operations.droidconKE's data comes
from a few different sources -  user data is stored in
[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/)
(either remotely or in
a local cache for offline use), user preferences and settings are stored in
SharedPreferences, conference data is stored remotely and is fetched and stored
in memory for the app to use, etc. - and the repository modules
are responsible for handling all data operations and abstracting the data sources
from the rest of the app (we liked using Firestore, but if we wanted to swap it
out for a different data source in the future, our architecture allows us to do
so in a clean way).

## Firebase

The app makes considerable use of the following Firebase components:

-  [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) is our source
for all conference and user data. Firestore gave us automatic sync  and also 
seamlessly managed offline functionality for us.
- [Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/)
allowed us to detect bugs and catch errors.
- [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options)
let us inform the app about changes to conference data on our server.
- [Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/) helped us
manage in-app constants.
- [Firebase Authentification](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) helped us 
to provide easy and secure authentification using email.
